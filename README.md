# Advent of Code 2018
This is a collection my solutions written in Python for 
[Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018). This was my first year
playing and enjoyed it quite a bit so thank you to Eric Wastl for hosting.

Solutions were written to solve the given problem as quickly as 
I could with only minor cleanup before uploading. So please forgive
terrible variable names, inefficient algorithms, big blocks of commented
out code, unused functions, and basically everything I would get called
out on in a code review.

The puzzle input for each day N is saved in a file N.in that was not 
included in this repo. Most days can be run with pypy for some speedup.
